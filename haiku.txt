The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.

An ancient pond
A frog jumps in
The splash of water
[Basho, 1685]

Old pond...
a frog leaps in
water's sound
